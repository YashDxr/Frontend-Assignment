## Project LIVE on: https://main--effortless-cocada-ff99d7.netlify.app

## Project Description
    The React application will have two main components: the JSON editor component and the form preview component. The JSON editor component will allow users to paste the UI-Schema in JSON format on the left-hand side. The form preview component will automatically render the form based on the pasted UI-Schema and display it on the right-hand side.

## Getting Started
    These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x.x or higher recommended)
- npm (v6.x.x or higher recommended)

    2. Install dependencies 
```bash
  cd Frontend-Assignment
  npm i or npm install
```


    3. Start the development server
```bash
  npm run dev
```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

## Building for production
